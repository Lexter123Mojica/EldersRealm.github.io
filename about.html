    <p style="color:#ffffff">Elder Realm is a free-to-play fantasy MMORPG from MDA and Elder Studio with a heavy focus on RvR combat and player competition. Players enlist into one of three warring realms and battle foes in a variety of RvR activities, with the objective to invade the enemy strongholds, capture their precious gems, and receive a special wish from the Golden Dragon. You can teamup with others or make a guild to finish a realm and get a rare item. </p>
